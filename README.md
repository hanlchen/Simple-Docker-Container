This containerized setup is efficient and streamlined:

The repository is hosted on Amazon ECR, with GitHub Actions configured to automatically rebuild containers on AWS upon each commit.
Core pages can be developed to capture and manage user requests.
The architecture allows for easy integration of additional features, such as training and inference APIs, as needed.
